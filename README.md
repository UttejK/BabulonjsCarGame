# Car Game Demo

- This project is Build using Gatsby, React, BabylonJs, and Typescript. you can start the development server by calling `npm run develop`, and build it using `npm run build`.
- You can control the car using `W` `A` `S` and `D` keys.
- The car only turns when both the forward keys and the sideway keys are pressed at the same time. Meaning you cannot rotate the car while its still, you can only rotate the car when one of the forward or backward buttons are being pressed.
- The car gradually accelerates and reaches a maximum velocity, and the same works for backwards. It can also slow down if the respective opposite button is pressed.
