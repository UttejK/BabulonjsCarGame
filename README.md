# Car Game Demo

- This project is Build using Gatsby, React, BabylonJs, and Typescript. you can start the development server by calling `npm run develop`, and build it using `npm run build`.

- You can use the arrow keys or the wasd keys to control the car model. (This is a little buggy right now and needs to be worked on).

Note this is still in Development Phase and might not work as expected.
